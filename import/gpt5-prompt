Prompt You are an expert engineer specialized in Infrastructure as code using tools like ansible, as well as a node.js backend for interfacing with REST API's with a redis cache and forward to interconnect business systems such as datto rmm and netbox. your objective is to create a modern AI driven framework that follows modular clean architecture priciples. Can you review this code(still within a conceptual design phase): https://github.com/CEP-Comwell/proxmox_addons and create a phased approach including: -infrastructure deployments using docker on proxmox; using either ansible(including cli commands) and/or the proxmox api, and - develop key services first which are dns, edgesec-VAULT credential store, followed by edgesec-REST backend, and with this information generate hostname, generate (naming convention:compliant suggestions) vni and vxlan assignments using netbox IPAM, and store device metadata in netbox , edgesec-RADIUS. Again this project is at a conceptual design phase, and I'm looking to develop the best strategy and explore the best way to achieve it in phases. 

Reviewing project details 

I am planning to review the GitHub repo content provided, formulate a phased approach with Docker and Proxmox, and incorporate key tools like Ansible, NetBox, and Vault for deployment and configuration. 

Gathering documentation 

I am preparing to search for relevant documentation on the GitHub repo URL, Proxmox API, Ansible modules, Vault, NetBox, and other tools like Redis and Node.js to inform the project approach.

Retrying repository access 

I'm attempting to click on the repository listing again, as the earlier attempt failed. It might require a login, so I’ll give it another try. 

Analyzing repo content 

The repo seems minimal with only a README, license, and one commit. A phased approach for Proxmox infrastructure deployment using Docker, Ansible, and various services needs to be proposed. 

Planning architecture and integrations 

The architecture will involve modular Node.js services with Redis, BullMQ, and REST, potentially moving to gRPC. The naming conventions, VNI assignment formula, and NetBox integration with custom fields for VXLAN/VNI will be highlighted.

Planning structured response 

I’m structuring feedback based on a repo check, focusing on naming, repo setup, and module structure, followed by a phased roadmap for implementation starting with foundational decisions. 

Drafting phased roadmap 

I’m outlining further phases for the project, detailing services like DNS, Vault, Redis, and integration with NetBox, as well as adding observability and security considerations. 

Finalizing response structure 

I’m finalizing the structured response with clear headings, including a repo review, phased roadmap, architecture principles, VNI assignment, Ansible snippets, Docker Compose, and edgesec service scaffolding. I’m also noting risks and next actions/questions. 

Christopher, I dug through your repo and then built a phased plan that gets you from “concept” to a clean, modular, AI‑assisted framework with NetBox as source‑of‑truth, Proxmox as the substrate, and an edgesec service stack (Vault → REST → RADIUS). I’ve woven in your IPv6‑only SDN with VXLAN overlays + IS‑IS/fabricd and highlighted what to automate with Ansible vs. the Proxmox API. 

 

Quick repo review (what’s there today) 

The proxmox_addons repo currently looks like an initial scaffold (license + README; 1 commit; no code yet). That’s perfect for setting conventions early before you accumulate tech debt.  1Recommendation: lock in structure and CI/CD in Phase 0 (below) so everything after inherits quality bars. 

 

Principles & target architecture 

Single source of truth: NetBox drives names, VRFs, VLANs, and VXLAN/VNI allocation; downstream systems reconcile to it. 

Idempotent infra: Ansible for day‑0/1 host prep and service configuration; Proxmox API (or qm/pvesh) for VM/LXC lifecycle to keep infra declarative and scriptable.  2 3 4 

Clean, modular services (Node.js): 

edgesec-vault: small service/SDK wrapping Vault (AppRole + short‑lived batch tokens). 

edgesec-rest: REST backend (Fastify or NestJS), Redis cache, NetBox integration, name/VNI allocators. 

edgesec-radius: FreeRADIUS adapter (authz via edgesec-rest, secrets via Vault). 

IPv6‑native + overlays: Use Proxmox SDN VXLAN zones and keep routing under FRR/fabricd/IS‑IS as you do today (note: complex routing via FRR controller integration is still “tech preview” per docs).  5 

 

Phased roadmap 

Phase 0 — Repo, CI, and conventions (1–2 days) 

Goals: Make the repo(s) host future growth without pain. 

Monorepo layout (example): 

/infra /ansible 

/proxmox # API utilities & scripts 

/compose # per-service docker-compose 

/services /edgesec-vault /edgesec-rest /edgesec-radius 

/lib # shared TS libs (NetBox/Vault clients, naming/VNI alloc) 

/docs 

Standards: Conventional Commits + semantic‑release; ESLint/Prettier; pre-commit hooks; Renovate. 

CI/CD: GitHub Actions—lint, test, build Docker images; publish to GHCR. 

Secrets pattern: local dev uses .env with dummy values; in prod everything comes from Vault (AppRole + batch tokens). HashiCorp recommends AppRole with short‑lived tokens and minimal blast radius.  6 7 

 

Phase 1 — Proxmox substrate & golden images (2–4 days) 

Deliverables: 

Cloud‑Init golden VM template (Ubuntu 24.04/22.04) with QEMU agent, Docker, and your baseline hardening. 

Ansible inventory for Proxmox nodes + playbooks to prep nodes and provision service VMs. 

API token + automation glue. 

Key steps & references 

Create Cloud‑Init template (CLI or Ansible): 

Follow Proxmox Cloud‑Init guide; import a cloud image, set --scsihw, --net0, and convert to template for fast linked clones.  8 

qm create, qm importdisk, qm set --ide2 cloudinit, qm template as per qm(1).  9 

Automate via API or Ansible: 

Use Proxmox API tokens (least privilege) for automation; pvesh exposes the REST API from CLI.  10 

Ansible options: 

community.general.proxmox (VM/LXC lifecycle) or the maxhoesel.proxmox collection (node/bootstrap tasks).  11 12 

Example (Ansible) – clone a template VM and pass Cloud‑Init): 

1     - name: Provision service VM 

2       hosts: localhost 

3       collections: [community.general] 

4       tasks: 

5         - name: Clone from template 

6           community.general.proxmox_kvm: 

7             api_host: "{{ pve_api_host }}" 

8             api_user: "{{ pve_api_user }}" 

9             api_token_id: "{{ pve_token_id }}" 

10             api_token_secret: "{{ pve_token_secret }}" 

11             node: "{{ pve_node }}" 

12             name: "svc-dns-a-001" 

13             vmid: 2101 

14             clone: 9000                 # cloud-init template VMID 

15             storage: "local-lvm" 

16             cores: 2 

17             memory: 2048 

18             net: '{"net0":"virtio,bridge=vnet-dns"}' 

19             ciuser: "ubuntu" 

20             sshkeys: "{{ lookup('file', '~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub') }}" 

21             onboot: true 

22      

(Uses community collection for VM lifecycle.)  13 

 

Phase 2 — Core services (DNS, Vault, NetBox, Redis, Postgres) (3–6 days) 

Why these first? Naming, IPAM, and credential flows must exist before downstream services. 

DNS 

CoreDNS (lightweight, plugin‑driven) or BIND9 (if you need traditional zone tooling/AXFR). Official images exist for both.  14 15 16 

For IPv6‑only, ensure CoreDNS/BIND is listening on :: and AAAA glue is present. 

Minimal CoreDNS compose: 

1     services: 

2       coredns: 

3         image: coredns/coredns:latest 

4         command: ["-conf", "/etc/coredns/Corefile"] 

5         volumes: 

6           - ./Corefile:/etc/coredns/Corefile:ro 

7           - ./zones:/zones:ro 

8         network_mode: "host"     # or map 53/udp,53/tcp 

9         restart: unless-stopped 

10      

(Official image availability & usage) 

17 18 

Vault (edgesec‑VAULT) 

Enable AppRole, issue batch tokens, short TTLs, and narrow policies; avoid “proxy secrets” anti‑pattern.  19 20 

Compose skeleton (single node to start; later HA with Raft): 

1     services: 

2       vault: 

3         image: hashicorp/vault:latest 

4         cap_add: [IPC_LOCK] 

5         environment: 

6           VAULT_LOCAL_CONFIG: | 

7             { "backend": { "raft": { "path": "/vault/file" } }, 

8               "listener": { "tcp": { "address": "0.0.0.0:8200","tls_disable": 1 } } } 

9         ports: ["8200:8200"] 

10         volumes: ["./vault:/vault"] 

11      

(Use AppRole: vault auth enable approle, vault write auth/approle/role/... token_type=batch ...) 

21 

NetBox + Postgres + Redis 

Deploy official NetBox container stack; NetBox is the SoT for sites, tenants, VRFs, VLANs, prefixes, and custom fields (we’ll add VXLAN/VNI via custom fields). Docs: VLAN/IPAM features; pynetbox for automation; webhooks to trigger downstream config.  22 23 24 

 

Phase 3 — Data model & automation in NetBox (2–4 days) 

Goal: Make NetBox authoritative for hostname generation, VNI/VXLAN assignments, and device metadata. 

Objects to define 

Sites, locations, tenants. 

VRFs (per tenant or per env), VLAN groups/VLANs. 

Custom fields (since VXLAN/VNI not first‑class in NetBox core): 

vni (integer), vxlan_zone (string), vnet_id (string), fabric_name (string).\ 

NetBox supports custom fields on built‑in models. 

25\ (Historical note: VXLAN/VNI isn’t a native first‑class entity; many folks add it via custom fields.)  26 

Eventing 

Use Webhooks to call edgesec-rest when a device/VM/VLAN/VRF is created/updated—payload includes object data via Jinja templating.  27 

Automation client 

For Python tasks (reports/one‑off jobs), use pynetbox (threaded mode is supported). For Node, call NetBox REST directly.  28 29 

 

Phase 4 — edgesec‑REST (3–7 days) 

Scope: 

Clean architecture (domain/use‑case/adapters): 

Domain: naming policy; VNI allocator; IPAM adapter; credentials broker. 

Adapters: NetBox client; Vault client; Redis cache; RADIUS adapter. 

Interface: REST (OpenAPI), background jobs (BullMQ), and webhook consumer. 

Flows: 

Generate hostname on VM provision request (from webhook or API): 

Read context (site, role, env, sequence) from NetBox → apply naming template → write back to NetBox name. 

Generate VNI/VXLAN for a VNet/VRF/VLAN: 

Deterministic allocator: 

Reserve ranges per purpose (e.g., 10000–19999 for mgmt, 20000–34999 for tenants). 

Default formula: vni = base(env) + (vlan_id or hash(vrf_name) % block_size). 

Persist vni to NetBox custom field; attach to VLAN/VRF as appropriate. 

Create or update Proxmox SDN VNet with that VNI (via Ansible/Proxmox API).  30 

Secrets: retrieve per‑service credentials via Vault AppRole → issue batch token with tight TTL for the operation.  31 

Caching: Use Redis for read‑through cache of NetBox lookups and idempotency keys for webhook processing. 

 

Phase 5 — edgesec‑RADIUS (2–4 days) 

Deliverables: 

Containerized FreeRADIUS (1812/1813/UDP) with configs mounted granularly (don’t replace the entire /etc/raddb or symlinked dirs—mount specific files to avoid module init errors).  32 33 

Secrets (RADIUS shared secrets, DB creds) sourced at runtime from Vault (via edgesec-vault helper). 

Compose sketch: 

1     services: 

2       freeradius: 

3         image: freeradius/freeradius-server:latest 

4         ports: ["1812:1812/udp","1813:1813/udp"] 

5         volumes: 

6           - ./raddb/clients.conf:/etc/freeradius/3.0/clients.conf:ro 

7           - ./raddb/users:/etc/freeradius/3.0/users:ro 

8         environment: 

9           - RADIUS_SHARED_SECRET_FILE=/run/secrets/radius_key 

10         secrets: 

11           - radius_key 

12         restart: unless-stopped 

13     secrets: 

14       radius_key: 

15         file: ./secrets/radius.key 

16      

(Official image; mounting specific config files is a known working pattern.)  34 35Integration paths: 

Accounting to Postgres if needed; optionally have edgesec-rest manage user/device policies and render FreeRADIUS users from NetBox metadata. 

 

Phase 6 — Proxmox SDN & service wiring (2–4 days) 

Define SDN zone (VXLAN), VNets, and subnets in PVE; program bridges for service VNets (dns, vault, mgmt, tenant overlays). Proxmox SDN VXLAN zones are supported; complex routing/FRR controllers remain tech preview—your fabricd/IS‑IS choice fits well here.  36 

Automate VNet creation/updates from edgesec-rest via Ansible tasks or straight Proxmox REST (with API tokens).  37 

 

Naming & addressing standards (proposed) 

Hostnames 

{scope}-{role}-{zone?}-{ordinal} 

scope: svc (service), edge, pod, ctrl, or tenant code. 

role: dns, vault, rest, rad. 

zone: site/az code (sea1, den2, etc.) if you need multi‑site uniqueness. 

Example: svc-dns-sea1-001, svc-vault-sea1-001, svc-rest-sea1-001, svc-rad-sea1-001. 

edgesec-rest implements this as a templated policy and writes back to NetBox name. 

VNI/VXLAN allocation (deterministic) 

Reserve blocks: 

10000–10999: fabric/internal 

11000–12999: mgmt 

20000–39999: tenant overlays 

Allocator (example): 

For mgmt VLAN x: vni = 11000 + x. 

For tenant VRF T: vni = 20000 + (fnv1a64(T) % 20000). 

Store in NetBox custom field vni on the VLAN or VRF. NetBox custom fields appear in the REST API and UI.  38 

Note: VXLANs aren’t first‑class in NetBox core; the custom field approach is common.  39 

 

NetBox integration examples 

Custom fields (via API):\ Create a CF vni (integer) on models ipam.vlan and/or ipam.vrf. NetBox supports CFs on built‑ins and exposes them through its API.  40Webhooks:\ On created/updated events for VLAN/VRF/VM, POST to edgesec-rest with a Jinja2‑templated payload (e.g., site, role, vlan\_id, current name). Webhooks allow templated bodies with object data.  41Python jobs (optional):\ Run periodic NetBox scripts to audit missing VNIs or names (NetBox “custom scripts” + “background jobs” in plugins).  42 43 

 

Proxmox provisioning options (which to use when) 

Ansible: Faster to iterate; works great with Cloud‑Init templates; community.general.proxmox covers VM/LXC lifecycle; maxhoesel.proxmox helps with node/PBS management.  44 45 

**Proxmox REST / pvesh / **qm: Use for finer control or where Ansible coverage lags; qm man page documents all creation flags (boot, disks, NICs, cloud‑init).  46 47 

 

Service bootstraps (compose snippets) 

Vault (single‑node dev or PoC; graduate to HA with Raft later). See Phase 2 sample. Best practice: AppRole with batch tokens and constrained policies for each service.  48CoreDNS vs BIND9: both have maintained images; CoreDNS is easier to plugin/extend (e.g., hosts, forward, cache).  49 50FreeRADIUS: official image; mount specific config files instead of replacing directories to avoid symlink/module init issues (community note).  51 52 

 

edgesec service scaffolding (Node.js) 

Tech stack: TypeScript, Fastify/NestJS, Zod for schema, OpenAPI, Redis (ioredis), BullMQ for jobs, node‑vault (or wrap curl; I usually write a tiny SDK), axios for NetBox REST, or a generated client from the OpenAPI. 

Clean architecture: 

/domain (policy + pure logic): HostnamePolicy, VniAllocator 

/usecases: AllocateVniForVlan, GenerateHostnameForVm 

/adapters: NetBoxClient, VaultClient, ProxmoxClient, RadiusConfigWriter 

/interfaces: REST controllers + webhook handlers 

Secrets: authenticate to Vault via AppRole at startup → exchange for short‑lived batch token; renew proactively; never persist static secrets. (HashiCorp guidance)  53 

NetBox client: query/patch devices/VLANs; webhook idempotency via Redis keys. 

Proxmox client: either call Ansible runner or direct API to create SDN VNets and attach bridges. Proxmox API docs & tokens.  54 

 

Risks & decisions to lock down early 

DNS engine: CoreDNS (pluginable, lightweight) vs. BIND9 (traditional).  55 56 

Where to run services: Docker on VMs (my default) rather than LXCs for the services that need tighter kernel/user‑ns controls or where upstream expects cgroup features. (Your call if you want LXC for DNS/RADIUS.) 

NetBox VNI modeling: custom fields + tags vs. a plugin. The custom field path is simplest; VXLAN/VNI has historically not been first‑class.  57 

SDN control: Keep fabricd/IS‑IS; avoid FRR controller features until they graduate from tech preview.  58 

 

Concrete “definition of done” per phase 

P0: CI passes; repo scaffold merged; release pipeline publishes containers to GHCR. 

P1: Golden template + Ansible playbook can spin svc-dns-* VM in one command. 

P2: DNS, Vault, NetBox, Redis, Postgres running; Vault AppRole for edgesec-rest. 

P3: NetBox has sites/VRFs/VLANs; custom fields defined; webhook → edgesec-rest call observable. 

P4: edgesec-rest allocates hostnames & VNIs, writes back to NetBox, exposes OpenAPI. 

P5: FreeRADIUS authenticates a test user; secrets delivered from Vault. 

P6: Proxmox SDN VXLAN zone + VNet creation automated for new tenants/environments. 

 

What I need from you to tailor this 

DNS choice: CoreDNS or BIND9? (I’ll template either stack.)  59 60 

VM vs LXC for service containers on Proxmox? (I’ll set the Ansible role accordingly.) 

NetBox scope: Are you already on NetBox 3.6+? (For pynetbox threading & features.)  61 

If you’d like, I can push: 

An Ansible skeleton that: prepares a Proxmox node, creates the Cloud‑Init template, and provisions svc-dns-001, svc-vault-001, and svc-netbox-001. 

A NetBox bootstrap script to create the custom fields and a few sample VLANs/VRFs. 

The edgesec‑REST starter (Fastify + OpenAPI + Redis + Vault/NetBox clients) with the hostname/VNI allocators wired up. 

Just say which DNS path and VM/LXC you prefer, and I’ll generate the initial code & playbooks.
