underlay: configure physical network interfaces and Linux bridges (vmbr10, vmbr20, vmbr30)
verify_underlay: validate connectivity on underlay VLANs

bgp: configure FRR BGP sessions between spines and leafs
verify_bgp: ensure BGP neighbors are established and routes are learned

vxlan: create VXLAN devices for internal, proxy, ceph_pub, ceph_cluster overlays
verify_vxlan: validate VXLAN interfaces are up and VTEP IPs reachable

ipam: assign IP addresses from IPAM pools to overlays
verify_ipam: check assigned IP addresses correspond to pool allocations

vm_nic: attach VMs to appropriate bridges using Proxmox API or Cloud-Init
verify_vm_nic: confirm VMs have correct network interfaces and IPs

nat: apply SNAT rules for egress from internal network (vmbrinternal)
verify_nat: test NAT egress by pinging external targets with correct source

proxy: set up Proxmox firewall rules for ingress (DNAT/ACCEPT)
verify_proxy: verify firewall rules allow HTTP, HTTPS, ICMP to proxy VM

ceph_pub: configure Ceph public network bridge (vmbrceph_pub)
verify_ceph_pub: ensure OSDs/clients can reach each other on public network

ceph_cluster: configure Ceph cluster network bridge (vmbrceph_cluster) for OSD-to-OSD or ZFS replication
verify_ceph_cluster: verify inter-OSD communication and ZFS replication over this bridge

validation: generic end-to-end smoke tests
verify_overall: run comprehensive health checks across all overlays
