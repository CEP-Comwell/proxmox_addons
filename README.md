# PROXMOX_ADDONS

This repository provides advanced Ansible automation and monitoring add-ons for Proxmox-based hyper-converged infrastructure.  
It is organized into modular subprojects, each with its own documentation and roles.

## ðŸ“¦ Subprojects

### [Proxmox VM & Docker Traffic Mirroring](traffic_mirror.md)
#### Proxmox VM & Docker Traffic Mirroring

**Overview:**
Automates mirroring of VM and Docker network traffic to a monitoring bridge for DPI, IDS, or security analysis. Supports dynamic discovery and persistent setup of tap and Docker bridge interfaces.

**Features:**
- Dynamic tap and Docker bridge discovery
- Automated veth/bridge setup and teardown
- Persistent traffic mirroring for DPI/IDS
- Automated cleanup routines

**Quick Start:**
1. See [traffic_mirror.md](traffic_mirror.md) for setup instructions.
2. Configure monitoring bridge and interfaces in `config.yml`.
3. Run the relevant playbooks to enable mirroring.

**Configuration Options:**
- Monitoring bridge and interface settings in `config.yml`
- Per-host variables in `host_vars/`

**Integration Points:**
- Integrates with SDN Fabric for network topology
- Supports DPI/IDS tools via mirrored traffic

- [traffic_mirror.md](traffic_mirror.md)
- [docs/integration-guide.md](docs/integration-guide.md)

### [Proxmox SDN Fabric: Automated Multi-Site Spine-Leaf with OpenFabric](Fabric_bootstrap.md)
#### Proxmox SDN Fabric: Automated Multi-Site Spine-Leaf with OpenFabric

**Overview:**
Comprehensive Ansible framework for deploying a scalable, multi-site spine-leaf network fabric across Proxmox nodes and locations, powered by OpenFabric. Implements zero trust and microsegmentation strategies for hyper-converged infrastructure.

**Features:**
- Automated multi-site fabric bootstrap and configuration
- Spine-leaf topology with OpenFabric integration
- Zero trust, microsegmentation, and RBAC support
- Dynamic inventory and network map generation
- Integration with Vault for secrets management

**Quick Start:**
1. Review [Fabric_bootstrap.md](Fabric_bootstrap.md) for prerequisites and setup steps.
2. Configure your environment in `inventory` and `config.yml`.
3. Run the provided playbooks to deploy the fabric.

**Configuration Options:**
- Centralized settings in `config.yml`
- Per-node and per-site variables in `group_vars/` and `host_vars/`
- Vault integration for sensitive data

**Integration Points:**
- Works with EdgeSec-RADIUS for authentication
- Integrates with EdgeSec-REST backend for device enrollment
- Supports traffic mirroring for DPI/IDS via VM & Docker roles

**References:**
- [Fabric_bootstrap.md](Fabric_bootstrap.md)
- [docs/architecture.md](docs/architecture.md)
- [docs/integration-guide.md](docs/integration-guide.md)

### [EdgeSec-RADIUS](edgesec-radius.md)
#### EdgeSec-RADIUS

**Overview:**
Modular Ansible role for multi-tenant, certificate-based authentication and integration with Vault, Authentik, Smallstep CA, FreeRADIUS, and NetBox.

**Features:**
- Multi-tenant RADIUS authentication
- Certificate-based device enrollment
- Vault and Authentik integration
- Smallstep CA and FreeRADIUS support
- NetBox asset management

**Quick Start:**
1. Review [edgesec-radius.md](edgesec-radius.md) for setup and requirements.
2. Configure tenants and secrets in Vault and Ansible variables.
3. Deploy the role using the provided playbooks.

**Configuration Options:**
- Tenant and certificate settings in `group_vars/` and `host_vars/`
- Vault integration for secrets

**Integration Points:**
- Works with SDN Fabric for network access control
- Integrates with EdgeSec-REST for device onboarding

- [docs/security-best-practices.md](docs/security-best-practices.md)

### [EdgeSec-REST Backend](edgesec-rest/README.md)
#### EdgeSec-REST Backend

**Overview:**
Device enrollment backend following clean architecture and facade patterns. Provides REST API, CLI runner, and Jest tests for device onboarding and management.

**Features:**
- REST API for device enrollment and management
- CLI runner for automation
- Jest-based test suite
- Facade pattern for integration

**Quick Start:**
1. See [edgesec-rest/README.md](edgesec-rest/README.md) for setup and usage.
2. Configure backend settings in environment variables and config files.
3. Run the backend and CLI tools as described in the documentation.

**Configuration Options:**
- Environment variables for backend settings
- Config files for API and CLI options

**Integration Points:**
- Integrates with EdgeSec-RADIUS for device authentication
- Supports SDN Fabric for network provisioning
