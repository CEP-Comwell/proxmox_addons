LLM and Automated Assistant Instructions
======================================

Purpose
-------
This file is the canonical, machine-readable instruction for automated code assistants (LLMs, bots) and humans working on this repository. Before making edits, an assistant should read this file and `docs/contributing.md`.

Required checks (what the assistant must do before changing repo files)
- Read `docs/contributing.md` and `docs/role_readme_template.md` in full.
- Verify that the role you plan to modify has a one-line pointer to the role template in `roles/<role>/README.md` (the pointer should reference `docs/role_readme_template.md`).
- Run `scripts/validate_role_readmes.py` to confirm all role READMEs include the pointer.
- Run YAML and Ansible checks where appropriate (examples below).

Commands the assistant or contributor should run locally (from repo root)
```
python3 scripts/validate_role_readmes.py
yamllint -d "extends: default, rules: {line-length: {max: 160}, indentation: {spaces: 2}}" roles/<role>/tasks/*.yml
ansible-lint roles/<role>
ansible-playbook -i inventory path/to/playbook.yml --syntax-check
```

Behavioral notes for automated assistants
- Do not assume role README pointers exist. Validate and, if missing, either add the one-line pointer (create a commit) or prompt the human maintainer.
- Do not modify `docs/contributing.md` or `docs/role_readme_template.md` without explicit human review.
- Prefer using Ansible modules instead of raw shell commands where possible; shell tasks can complicate syntax-checks.

If you are an automated tool (CI, bot, or LLM integration), this repository expects you to run `scripts/validate_role_readmes.py` and fail fast if the pointer is missing. This makes the pointer a dependable signal for both humans and assistants.
